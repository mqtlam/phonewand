- TODO post demo day: (in general, for all of us)
	- Get rid of TTSActivity and put it into a service. Activities that require TTS
		will need to get the TTS object from the service.
	- Add speech confirmation to each action (as well as some vibration, which has been 
		done already by Chris)
	- Before transitioning to next screen, speech should end.
	- For the list screen, add something like "1 of 6." add the beginning of speech
		so user knows which item she's at.
	- For each screen, speak the screen name.
	- On screen accessible keyboard.
	- Make sure the toasts are TTS.
	- Double tap any where to select for lists
	- Disable title bar notification thing in list

-- KEYBOARD:
-- add a space below the navigation buttons
-- add a backspace button in addition to the others
-- add the ability to read the entire text one character at a time



-- state that the application is closing when we close it from an error
-- make it all useable by a blind person

-- Kill the TTS when we leave the screen/dialog/event
-- Add the sideways swipe transitions to the slider screens for uniformity
-- speak the current step of the route when the DirectionsDisplay screen opens?

------- instead of having the RouteInput screen try to determine if there is an Internet 
		connection and a location fix, just have the RouteOrienter screen return to 
		RouteInput if it doesn't find either of these.

-- ensure that the PossibleAddresses screen works

-- Current tasks:
		- moving code to the new RouteService,
		- instantiating/calling location code and web service code from the RouteFinder screen, 
		- adding code to the RouteFinder screen to not open RouteChecker unless there is a fix on current location, an Internet connection, and a valid route found from the user's specified destination,
		- rearranging code into a logical, easy-to-follow, delimited layout

--------- WE SHOULD HAVE AN "ADD MY CURRENT LOCATION TO DATABASE" BUTTON

--- some day, we need to display Google Maps copyright information in conjunction with the directions...

-- set the UNIT_SYSTEM field to be adjustable by the user

- figure out when to open and close the LocationManager (don't forget in onStart/onStop)
- if we ever wanted to include any sort of static audio cues/messages, we could easily make use of Alden's recording equipment
- add error handling with: Log.e messages, descriptive Toasts, verbal messages to the user
- should we create a super class which both screens extend?

- implement efficient way for Chris's code to JUST redraw the current location icon when orientation changes (not the whole route)
- implement a way for the code to ensure that the user's phone has the Google Maps library, and if not, to use the Google Maps Web API

Things we need to be able to tell the user:
	- there is no GPS signal/we're waiting for the GPS to connect
	- there is no Internet signal
	- turn left
	- turn right
	- you're facing the right way
	- you're there
	- the location you entered was invalid / please clarify your destination
	- you need to walk THIS far
	- this is what you have entered as a destination
	- these are some of your previously entered locations
